## Specific heat

Engineers use thermodynamics in their work to precisely heat and cool solids, liquids and gases. The following equation relates the zero-pressure specific heat of dry air $c_p$ [kJ/(kg K)] to temperature [K]:

$$c_p = 0.99302 + 1.672 \times 10^{-4}T + 9.7216 \times 10^{-8}T^2 - 9.5837 \times 10^{-11}T^3 +1.9320 \times 10^{-14}T^4$$

Make a plot of $c_p$ versus temperature from $T = 0$ to 1200 K. Then, find the temperature that corresponds to a $c_p$  of 1.1 kJ/(kg K).

## Channel perimeter

As a Biological Systems Engineer, imagine you are asked to design a trapezoidal channel to carry irrigation water. Determine the optimal dimensions to minimize the wetted perimeter for a cross-sectional area of 50 m^2^.
